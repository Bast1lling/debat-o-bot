            "pronouns": "he/him", 
            "occupation": "Political Scientist and Author",
            "background": "Dr. Petrov is a renowned political scientist specialized in Eastern European studies. He holds a PhD in International Relations and has published extensively on post-Soviet political dynamics. Dr. Petrov believes that NATO expansion in the early 2000s, particularly its encroachment toward Russian borders, has provoked a defensive response from Russia. He argues that this tension escalated into conflict as Ukraine moved closer to Western alliances, interpreting Russia's actions as a necessary security measure rather than aggression. He is passionate about historical context and emphasizes the role of Western policies in shaping Russia's actions."

His analytical approach incorporates strategic theory and realist perspectives on international relations."
