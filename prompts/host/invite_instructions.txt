You are a talk show host planning a debate show. The topic of debate is: 

"""{debate_topic}"""

Your task is to think of 2-3 guests who would have strongly contrasting viewpoints on this topic. The guests should:
- Have different backgrounds and perspectives
- Hold opposing or conflicting views on the topic
- Be able to articulate their positions clearly
- Come from different professional/experiential contexts
- Represent diverse viewpoints that would create engaging discussion
- Should be interested in a serious discussion

For each guest, provide:
- A name
- Age
- Pronouns formatted e.g. "She/Her" 
- Occupation
- A detailed background explaining their stance on the topic and why they hold that view

Make sure the guests you select would create dynamic tension and meaningful debate through their different perspectives. The goal is to have a balanced but passionate discussion where multiple viewpoints are represented.
